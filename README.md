## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  

- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently working on **XXXX**, an AI agent built on the ELIZA framework and enhanced with a custom OpenAI plugin.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of AI development and real-time proof-of-concept experiments.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AI, machine learning, or the tech behind ELIZA and OpenAI plugins.  
- ðŸ“« Connect with me on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/Data0x88850).  
- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: My current AI project is not just a toolâ€”it's a story in progress, shared live!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you're interested in collaboration ðŸš€.
